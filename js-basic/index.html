    <h1>JavaScript Introduction</h1>
    <p>Hello everyone this a html file with a "prac.js" file linked to it with the help of script tag.
        If you check the html file then you can see I have placed the script file below this para tag it has a reason of why a script tag must be placed below the main html content.
    It is because when the browser reads your file it reads it from top to bottom so as soon as it finds a script tag it will directly jump to that file and start reading that file so in this case your website rendering can slow down causing the user to get confused or frustrated. <br>
So I'll recommend to place the script tag below you html main content.
Now to see your js op right click on the browser window and click on inspect and then a window must open up in that window click on Console there you may see the output of you javascript file. <br>
For refrence while your learning javascript I would recommend you to refer <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3school</a> they have good documentation of JS. </p>
